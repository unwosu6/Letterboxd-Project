# issues: data takes time, maybe load in five at a time?
# issues/future: How to incorprate the use of databases in this
# future: output info to user abt what scores had biggest differences
# future: have the user input the file name
# future: put in try except blocks for possible errors (wrong file)
# future: right now we ignore movies we can't find on rt.
# future: expand to different review websites to find movies we can't initially find
# future: expand to other websites to get info on genre and studio
# flow diagram to explain what csv is for vs what api is for
# expansion: if you record for a differt user on average how different they are with their music taste
# after n number of users you can show that how each user compares to eachother with their difference
# on average
# bar graphs could be interestings to see how many things they rated
# axis could be the differences. are there lots of differences or are there lots of things different
